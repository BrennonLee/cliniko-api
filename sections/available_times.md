``` 
GET /businesses/:business_id/practitioners/:practitioner_id/appointment_types/:appointment_type_id/available_times?from=DATETIME&to=DATETIME 
```

**Required Parameters**

There are two parameters required, these form the time frame of available times requested:

`from` and `to` cannot be more than 7 days apart (ie. the maximum time period you can request is 7 days).

The time frame parameters have to be specified in UTC â€“ e.g. 2014-08-30T18:00:00Z
